## About Me 😐

I'm currently 23 with an associates degree in Electrical & Electronic Engineering in the bag and currently studying to become a computer scientist!

## Learning 📖

Throughout my years I've been exploring the various technology stacks and how they interact to form the products we use everyday. From low-level languages
and frameworks to high-level web environments, I've played around with a lot to form projects such as:

- 🖥️ Webdev (React, PHP, HTML + CSS + JS, Node, Ruby) 
  - 👕 [Clothing Shop in Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/DanielAtanasovski/RMIT_RAD2021_s3658474) 
  - ✅ [Quiz Game in Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/DanielAtanasovski/RMIT_RAD2021_s3658474)
  - 🚌 [Public Transport Planning with PHP & Google Cloud](https://github.com/DanielAtanasovski/RMIT_CloudComputing-PTVPlanner) 
- 🎮 Gamedev (Godot, Unity, Monogame, OpenGL + SDL, PhaserJS)
  - 🪨 [First School OpenGL Project](https://github.com/DanielAtanasovski/RMIT_Asteroid_Arena_GL) 
  - ⏹️ [Menger Sponge in OpenGL](https://github.com/DanielAtanasovski/RMIT_RTRAssignment1) 
  - 🏎️ [Simple Racing Game in Phaser + JS](https://github.com/DanielAtanasovski/Simple-Racing) 
- 🏫 Random School Projects (Java, C++, Python)
  - 🕵️ [Stegenography Project in Java](https://github.com/DanielAtanasovski/Java-Steganography) 
  - 🔗 [Attempt at a local Implementation of a blockchain in Java](https://github.com/DanielAtanasovski/RMIT_Java-Blockchain) 

## Recent ⏰

I've most recently worked on [The Last Void](https://justdevdan.itch.io/the-last-void) for GoGodot Jam 2. While it was my first public foray into a Godot game project,
I'm happy with the variety work I put into it and will continue to explore this project.
