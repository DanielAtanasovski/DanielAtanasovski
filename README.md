## Projects 📖

Throughout my years I've been exploring the various technology stacks and how they interact to form the products we use everyday. From low-level languages
and frameworks to high-level web environments, I've played around with a lot to form projects such as:

- 🖥️ Webdev (React, PHP, HTML + CSS + JS, Node, Ruby)
