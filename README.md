## About Me 😐

I'm currently 23, and studying to become a computer scientist. 

Right now, i've more recently participated in a game-jam and looking to finish my degree within the year!

## Learning 📖

I've played around with:
- Webdev (React, PHP, HTML + CSS + JS, Node)
- Gamedev (Godot, Unity, Monogame, OpenGL + SDL)
- Random School Projects (Java, C++, Python)

## Recent ⏰

I've most recently worked on [The Last Void](https://justdevdan.itch.io/the-last-void) for GoGodot Jam 2. While it was my first public foray into a Godot game project,
I'm happy with the variety work I put into it and will continue to explore this project.
